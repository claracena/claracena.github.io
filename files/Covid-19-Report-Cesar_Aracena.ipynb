    "The following is a list of steps taken for the creation of the Covid-19 Dashboard at https://datastudio.google.com/s/s4U9oFwAABQ\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data source\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was gathered from https://ourworldindata.org/ from February 20, 2020 until March 25, 2022. It was downloaded in CSV format.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "After getting the data, it was opened in MS Excel and cleaned/normalized by ensuring all columns had uniform data and no data was duplicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data had been clean and normalized, I moved the population column so it was 5th in order along the demographics and took the first columns (demographics) with the first part of columns (information about deaths mostly) and exported it as CSV. Then I took the later columns (mostly about vaccination) and pair it alongside the demographic columns and exported that as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once I had two CSV files, each one with less columns than the original file, I created a new database in MS SQL and imported them as tables. OOnce I checked everything was imported correctly (quantity of rows in each table and columns structure), I proceeded to make the necessary aggregations for the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Aggregation in SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a short summary of the most important queries excecuted in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "First I calculated the overall totals worldwide:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Total Covid-19 cases\n",
    "- Total Covid-19 related deaths\n",
    "- Percentage from total Covid-19 that ended in deaths\n",
    "\n",

    "FROM [covid-db].dbo.deaths\n",
    "WHERE continent IS NOT NULL\n",
    "ORDER BY 1, 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I added all the cases for each country and total deaths reported from Covid-19 and calculated the total death percentage.\n",
